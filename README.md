# hello-world
hello all. havent done any coding since i was a teenager. this was of course many many moons ago. however
with a renewed interest in my model train quests ive discovered the oppurtunities that a simple uno opens up
so be patient with the questions as i try to learn c++ after learning BASIC all those years ago
